# Amendment Proposal to the Destruction of Unactivated Genesis Accounts and Tokens FIP#11

Proposer: Awake, Sky.eosc

On the basis of FIP#9 A Proposal to Destroy Unactivated Genesis Accounts and Tokens, it is considered that during the process of upgrading and implementing the codes, destroying the accounts and account balance involves a large change in the blockchain account book. To better respect the spirit of the blockchain, Awake proposes to amend the original destruction proposal.

Instead of destroying the account balance, it is amended to “freeze the remaining 20% of the unactivated account balance based on the previous lockup for 80% of the account balance”.
