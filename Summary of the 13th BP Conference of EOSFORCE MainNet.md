##### 1. Communication about the development issue of FIP#9 Destruction Proposal - Cyborg, Fan Yang


Communication about the development issue of FIP#9 Destruction Proposal


Fan Yang: From a technical perspective, there are two problems of destroying and freezing the accounts and tokens: 1. The work is too burden-some to mark these frozen accounts; 2.There is a contradiction between the blockchain spirit and destruction. Because the blockchain consensus is that only private key can use the asset. Two solutions to freeze the tokens of those accounts: 1. Develop the super privilege to freeze the accounts; 2. Exploit the bug to freeze the accounts.


Cyborg: We respect the opinions of the EOSForce community. If the proposal is voted to pass, the development team will implement the proposal. There are two plans, one is the super priviledge, another is to re-run the blocks. The problem of super provilege is that the accounts have not been marked as activated or unactivated. So theoretically, if those unactivated tokens can be destroyed, then everyone's tokens can also be destroyed. Moreover, with the super privilege theory, if the tokens can be destroyed, they can also be revovered technically.

##### The Secretariat proposes on node voting - Sky
Proposal: The final result of the community proposal is subject to the multi-signature

The resolutiopn passed by this term of BPs cannot be mapped to the link and take effect. The proposal can only be effective when BPs make the implementation. So even the proposal is passed at the meeting, there may be the following questions before the multi-signature:

1.There are different opinions before the node execute multi-signature; 

2.After the proposal passed, the term of BPs have changed. The new BP have different opinions and refuse to multi-signature. 

3.Eosc is a parallel public chain of EOS. Should have a blockchain voting spirit. Since it is reacted on the EOSC chain. Therefore, the result should be decided by multi-signatures.

##### 3.New proposal on FIP#9 Destruction Proposal - Awake

Instead of destroying the account balance, it is amended to “freeze the remaining 20% or 19% of the unactivated account balance".

On the basis of FIP#9 A Proposal to Destroy Unactivated Genesis Accounts and Tokens, it is considered that during the process of upgrading and implementing the codes, destroying the accounts and account balance involves a large change in the blockchain account book. To better respect the spirit of the blockchain, Awake proposes to amend the original destruction proposal.
Instead of destroying the account balance, it is amended to “freeze the remaining 20% of the unactivated account balance based on the previous lockup for 80% of the account balance”.
